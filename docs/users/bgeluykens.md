## About Me

With 25 years in IT, I bring a strong foundation in software development and over six years of experience as a Solution Architect. I’m passionate about bridging technology and business needs—designing solutions that deliver measurable value and lasting impact.

## What I Do

My focus is on **modernisation projects**, helping organisations transform and evolve with agility and resilience.  

- **Business First**: Every change starts with conscious alignment to business goals.  
- **Architecture Design**: Crafting scalable, resilient systems using domain-driven and event-driven paradigms. Scaling hexagonal architectures with clarity and intent.  
- **Agile Mindset**: Applying Agile practices to drive successful, sustainable transformations.  
- **Code Reviews & Mentorship**: Ensuring code quality and nurturing growth through knowledge sharing.  
- **Continuous Improvement**: Advocating for best practices across development, deployment, and monitoring.  

I believe in the power of **event-driven systems** to create responsive, maintainable, and extensible software. In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, I stay curious and committed—constantly learning, experimenting, and adapting.  

Let’s connect and talk about technology, event-driven architecture, or simply share ideas on building better software systems!
