      # Route

      A **Route** defines the path (or pattern) in a URL that the server should respond to, combined with a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). It is the fundamental rule that determines which **Request Handler** is responsible for an incoming request.

      A route is typically defined by a tuple: `(HTTP_METHOD, PATH_PATTERN)`.
      For example, the route `(GET, "/api/users")` is different from `(POST, "/api/users")`.

      ## Example
      In many web frameworks, routes are defined in a central dispatcher:
      ```java
      server.createContext("/api/users", new UserHandler()); // Route for /api/users
      ```

      # Endpoint

      An **Endpoint** is the "destination" or target URL a client (e.g., a web browser, mobile app) communicates with. It is often used synonymously with a **Route**, but can be more specific.

      While a *route* is the rule on the server, an *endpoint* is the address a client uses. A single endpoint (e.g., `https://api.example.com/users`) might be associated with multiple routes for different operations (GET, POST).

      ## Example Endpoints
      - `GET https://api.example.com/users` - Fetch a list of users
      - `POST https://api.example.com/users` - Create a new user
      - `GET https://api.example.com/users/123` - Fetch user with ID 123

    name: Request Handler
    summary: "The code responsible for processing an incoming HTTP request and generating an HTTP response."

      # Request Handler

      A **Request Handler** (or simply **Handler**) is a function, method, or object that contains the business logic to execute when a specific **Route** is matched. Its job is to process the incoming request (read parameters, headers, body) and build an appropriate **Response**.

      In the provided Java code, any class that extends `AbstractContextHandler` is a Request Handler. The `handleGet`, `handlePost` etc., methods within it are the specific handler functions for each HTTP method.

      ## Responsibilities
      1. Parse input from the `HttpExchange` object.
      2. Execute application logic (e.g., query a database, call another service).
      3. Construct and send a **Response** (status code, headers, body).

    name: Middleware
    summary: "Software that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses in a chain."
    description: |
      # Middleware

      **Middleware** is software that sits between the web server and the core application logic. It forms a pipeline through which **Requests** and **Responses** flow. Each middleware component can inspect, modify, or short-circuit the request/response cycle.

      Middleware is typically used for cross-cutting concerns that are separate from business logic.

      ## Common Uses
      - **Authentication:** Checking if a user is logged in.
      - **Logging:** Recording details about incoming requests.
      - **CORS:** Adding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers to responses.
      - **Parsing:** Automatically parsing JSON request bodies into objects.

      ## How it Works
      A request passes through each middleware in sequence before reaching the final **Request Handler**. The response then passes back through the middleware chain in reverse order.
      `Request -> Middleware 1 -> Middleware 2 -> Handler -> Middleware 2 -> Middleware 1 -> Response`

  - id: Response
    name: Response
    summary: "The output an HTTP server sends back to a client, containing a status, headers, and a body."
    description: |
      # Response

      The **Response** is the HTTP message a server returns to a client after processing its **Request**. It is the final output of a **Request Handler** and any **Middleware**.

      ## Key Components
      - **Status Code:** A 3-digit number indicating the result (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
      - **Headers:** Key-value pairs containing metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).
      - **Body:** The main content or payload of the response (e.g., HTML, JSON, plain text).

      In the provided code, the `sendResponse(exchange, 200, string)` method is responsible for building and sending the response.

    summary: "An incoming message from a client asking the server to perform an operation."
    description: |
      # Request

      An HTTP **Request** is a message sent by a client (like a web browser or another service) to trigger an action on the server. It is the input to the **Request Handler**.

      ## Key Components
      - **HTTP Method:** The action to perform (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
      - **URL/Path:** The target **Endpoint** and resource.
      - **Headers:** Key-value pairs containing metadata about the request (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer ...`, `Content-Type: ...`).
      - **Body:** The data sent to the server (common with POST/PUT requests).

      In Java's `com.sun.net.httpserver` package, the `HttpExchange` object encapsulates both the request and response.

    summary: "The verb (e.g., GET, POST) that defines the action for a request."
    description: |
      # HTTP Method

      Also known as HTTP verbs, **HTTP Methods** indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. They are a core part of defining a **Route**.

      ## Common Methods
      - **GET:** Retrieve a resource. Should not change server state.
      - **POST:** Create a new resource or submit data for processing.
      - **PUT:** Update or replace a resource.
      - **DELETE:** Remove a resource.
      - **PATCH:** Partially update a resource.

      The provided code's `HttpMethodData` object contains the method name to generate the correct handler method (e.g., `handleGet`).

    name: Dispatcher / Router
    summary: "The component that matches an incoming request's method and path to the correct Route and Request Handler."
    description: |
      # Dispatcher / Router

      The **Dispatcher** (or **Router**) is the core component of a web server that examines each incoming **Request** (its HTTP method and URL path) and determines which defined **Route** it matches. Once a match is found, the request is forwarded to the corresponding **Request Handler**.

      It is the traffic director of the web application.

      In the provided code, the `RouteDispatcher` class likely performs this role, routing requests to the appropriate instance of `AbstractContextHandler`.
